<pre>
+-----+       +-------+
| Car | ◆--->| Motor  |
+-----+     2 +-------+
</pre>

- "Owns-a" relationship (**composition**)
- Means the motor is part of the car
    - Does not have an independent existence
    - Copy/destroy the car => copy/destroy the motor (deep copies)
- Typical implementation - class composition, ie. object fields
- `m` on arrow indicates the name of the field
    - `class Car { Motor m; };`
- Number under arrow indicates how many fields

<pre>
+------+  0..*  +-------+
| Pond |◇------>| Ducks |
+------+        +-------+
</pre>

- "has-a" relationship (**aggregation**)
- Duck has its own independent existence
- Copy/destroy the pond =/=> copy/destroy the ducks
- Typical implementation: pointer field
- Ex. `class Pond { vector<Duck*> ducks; };` if you have more than one duck

The concept of _ownership_ is central to object oriented design in C++. 
- You probably don't need to care about managing resources, but you need to decide who will.

Every resource (memory, file, window) should be owned by an object that will release it (RAII). 
- A unique pointer _owns_ the memory it points to. 
- A raw pointer should be regarded as _not_ owning the memory it points.

If you need to point at the same object with several pointers, one pointer should own it and be a unique pointer. The rest should be raw pointers. Moving a unique pointer = transferring ownership.

If you need true shared ownership - we'll see later.

## **Measures of Design Quality**

- **Coupling**
    - How strongly different modules depend on each other
    - <u>Lower is better</u>
    - **Low** (ascending order):
        - Function calls with params/results of basic type 
        - Function calls with array/struct params
        - Modules affect each other's control flow
        - Modules share global data 
    - **High:**
        - Modules access each other's implementation (friends)
        - Changes to one module affect other modules
        - Harder to reuse individual modules
    - Example: method `whatItIs`, the one used `dynamic_cast` is tightly coupled with the `Book` class, and the structure of `Book` hierarchy.
    - I can achieve perfect coupling by putting everything in one class, so there must be a balancing force (low cohesion)
- **Cohesion**
    - How closely are the elements of a module related to each other
    - <u>Higher is better</u>
    - **Low:**
        - Arbitrary grouping (eg. `<utility>`)
        - Common theme, otherwise unrelated, maybe some common base code (eg. `<algorithm>`)
        - Elements manipulate state over the lifetime of an object
            - Ex. open/read/close files
        - Elements pass data to each other
    - **High:**
        - elements operate to perform exactly one task
    - Low cohesion means poorly organized code and harder to maintain/understand
    - I can achieve perfect cohesion by putting each method into its own class, but then they'll all depend on each other (high coupling).
- **We want high cohesion and low coupling**

## **SOLID principles of OO Design**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - A class should only have one reason to change
    - i.e. a class should do one thing, not several
    - Any change to the problem spec requires a change to the program
    - If changes to >= 2 different parts of the spec cause changes to the same class, SRP is violated
    - Ex. Don't let you (main) classes print things
        - Consider: 
        ```C++
        class ChessBoard {
            std::cout << "Your move";
        };
        ```
        - Bad design, inhibits code reuse
        - What if you want a version of your program that:
            - Communicates over different streams (file/network)
            - Works in another language?
            - Uses graphics instead of text?
        - Major changes to `ChessBoard` class, instead of reuse
        - Violates SRP, must change the class if there is any specification for:
            - Game rules
            - Strategy
            - Interface
            - Etc.
        - Low cohesion
        - Split these responsibilities up
        - One module (not main! can't reuse main) responsible for communication
            - If a class wants to say something, do it via parameters/results/exceptions
            - Pass info to communications object and let it do the talking
        - On the other hand - specifications that are unlikely to change may not need their own class - avoid needless complexity
            - Judgement call
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Classes/modules/functions/etc. should be open for extension + closed for modification
    - Changes in a program's behaviour should happen by writing new code, not by changing old code
    - Ex.
        ```
        +-----------+     +---------+
        | Carpenter |◆--->| Handsaw |
        +-----------+     +---------+

        ```
        - What if a carpenter buys a table saw
        - This design is not open for extension (must change carpenter code)
        - Solution: add an abstraction 
        ```
        +-----------+     +-----+
        | Carpenter |◆--->| Saw |
        +-----------+     +-----+
                             ^
                             |
                    +--------+----------+
                    |                   |
               +---------+        +-----------+
               | Handsaw |        | Table Saw |
               +---------+        +-----------+
               
        ```
    - Also recall: `countHeavy` (using virtual method) function, it is closed for modification:
        ```C++
        int countHeavy(const vector<Book *> &v) {
            int count = 0;
            for (auto &p: v)
                if (p->heavy()) ++ count;
            return count;
        }
        ```
    - vs. `whatIsIt`, when we used dynamic casting (not closed for modification)
    - **Note:** can't really be 100% closed, some changes may require source modification
      - These should be taken with a bit of common sense
      - Plan for the _most likely_ changes and make your code closed with respect to those changes
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Simply put: public inheritance must indicate an "IS-A" relationship
    - But there's more to it: If `B` is a subtype (subclass) of `A`, then we should be able to use an object `b` of type `B` in any context that requires an object of type `A` <u> without affecting the correctness of the program (*) </u>
    - C++'s inheritance rules already allow us to use subclass objects in place of superclass objects
    - (\*) Very important point: a program should "not be able to tell" if it is using a superclass object or a subclass object 
      - Note: arguably, `dynamic_cast` does violate LSP, depending on how you use it
      - Formally: if an invariant `I` is true of class `A`, then it is true of class `B`
      - If an invariant `I` is true of method `A::f`, and `B::f` overrides `A::f`, then `I` must hold for `B::f`
      - If `A::f` has a precondition `P` and a postcondition `Q`, then `B::f` must have a precondition `P' <= P` and a post condition `Q' => Q`
        ```
            P ===> Q
            |      ^
            V      |
            P'===> Q'
        ```
      - If `A::f` and `B::f` behave differently, the difference in behaviour must fall within what is allowed by the program's correctness specification
    - Ex.
        1. **Contravariance Problem**
            - Arises anytime you have a binary operator (ie. a method with an "other" parameter) of the same type as `*this`
                ```C++
                class Shape {
                    public:
                        virtual bool operator==(const Shape &other) const;
                        ...
                };
                class Circle: public Shape {
                    public:
                        bool operator==(const Circle &other) const override; // (*)
                }
                ```
            - (\*) Taking a `Circle` would violate LSP
              - A `Circle` _is_ a `Shape`
              - A `Shape` can be compared with _any_ other `Shape`
              - Therefore a `Circle` can be compared with _any_ other `Shape`
              - C++ will flag this problem with a compiler error
              - This is an OOP thing, not just a programming language thing, if your language does not force this, that language is flawed
              - **FIX:**
                  ```C++
                  bool Circle::operator==(const Shape &other) const {
                      if (typeid(other) != typeid(Circle)) return false;
                      const Circle &cOther = static_cast<const Circle&>(other);
                      // Compare fields of other with fields of *this;
                  }
                  ```
              - `dynamic_cast` vs `typeid`
                - `dynamic_cast<Circle &>(other);`: asking a slightly different question: is it possible to cast `other` to a `Circle`/is `other` a `Circle` or a subclass of `Circle`
                - `typeid(other) == typeid(Circle)`: is `other` precisely a `Circle`?
                - `typeid` returns an object of type `type_info`
        1. Is a square a rectangle?
            - A square has all the properties of a rectangle
                ```C++
                class Rectangle {
                    private:
                        int length, width;
                    public:
                        Rectangle(int length, int width):
                            length{length}, width{width} {}
                        int getLength() const;
                        int getWidth() const;
                        virtual void setLength(int newLength) { length = newLength;}
                        virtual void setWidth(int newWidth) { width = newWidth;};
                        int area() const { return length * width; }
                        // ...
                };
                ```
                ```C++
                class Square: public Rectangle {
                    public:
                        Square(int side): Rectangle{side, side} {}
                        void setLength(int newLength) override {
                            Rectangle::setLength(newLength);
                            Rectangle::setWidth(newLength);
                        }
                        void setWidth(int newWidth) override { ... } // Similar
                };
                ```
                ```C++
                int f(Rectangle &r) {
                    r.setLength(10);
                    r.setWidth(20);
                    return r.area();  // Expect 200
                }
                ```
                ```C++
                Square s{1};
                f(s);   // 400 instead of 200
                ```
            - `Rectangle` has the property that their length and width can vary independently; `Square` does not. So this violates LSP
            - On the other hand, an immutable `Square` could substitute for an immutable `Rectangle`
            - What can be done:

                       +-----------+       +--------+
            </pre>
    - Constraining what subclasses can do:
      ```C++
      class Turtle {
          public:
              virtual void draw() = 0;
      };
      ```
      ```C++
      class RedTurtle: public Turtle {
          public:
              void draw() override {
                  drawHead();
                  drawRedShell();
                  drawFeet();
              }
      };
      ```
      ```C++
      class GreenTurtle: public Turtle {
          public:
              void draw() override {
                  drawHead();
                  drawGreenShell();
                  drawFeet();
              }
      };    
      ```
      - Code duplication!
      - How can we ensure that overrides of `draw()` will always do these things?
        ```C++
        class Turtle {
            public:
                void draw() {
                    drawHead();
                    drawShell();
                    drawFeet();
                }
            private:
                void drawHead();
                virtual void drawShell() = 0;
                void drawFeet();
        };
        ```
        ```C++
        class RedTurtle: public Turtle {
            void drawShell() override { ... };
        };
        ```
        ```C++
        class GreenTurtle: public Turtle {
            void drawShell() override { ... };
        };
        ```
      - Subclasses cannot control the steps of drawing a turtle, not the drawing of head + feet
      - Can only control the drawing of a shell (called the **Template Method Pattern**)
    - Extension: **Non-Virtual Interface (NVI) Idiom**
      - If you think private pure virtual methods are weird, in fact, public pure virtual methods are weird, and private ones are normal
      - `public virtual` methods are simultaneously:
        - Part of a class' interface
          - Pre/post conditions
          - Respect invariants
        - "Hooks" for customizations by subclasses, overriding code could be anything
        - The two above mentioned points are at odds with each other (can't/hard to be both)
      - NVI says: All virtual methods should be private (except for destructor)
      - In other words, all public methods should be non-virtual
      - Ex. Non-NVI class
        ```C++
        class DigitalMedia {
            public:
                virtual void play() = 0;
        };
        ```
      - Now with NVI
        ```C++
        class DigitalMedia {
            public:
                void play() {
                    doPlay();
                }
            private:
                virtual void doPlay() = 0;
        };
        ```
        - What do I gained?
          - TLDR you can always take control of what would happen.
          - Because the public method `play` is non virtual and it is public, I can still have control over it. The subclasses cannot replace `play`, only `doPlay`.
          - Now, I can make promises, e.g, I can add `checkCopyright()` before `doPlay`.
        - In the future, can add before/after code
          - Ex. call `checkCopyright()` before, call `updatePlayCount()` afterwards
      - Generalizes the Template Method Pattern
        - Puts every virtual method function inside a template method
- **Interface Segregation Principle**
    - Many small interfaces is better than one large interface
    - If a class has many functionalities, each client of the class should only see the functionality that it needs
    - Ex. Video Game (will ignore NVI to keep example short)
      ```C++
      class Enemy {
          public:
              virtual void strike();  // Needed by game logic
              virtual void draw();    // Needed by UI'
      };
      ``` 
      ```C++
      class UI {
          vector<Enemy *> v;
      };
      ```
      ```C++
      class Battlefield {
          vector<Enemy *> v;
      };  
      ```
      - If we need to change the drawing interface, `Battlefield` must recompile for no reason
      - Creates needless coupling between `UI` and `Battlefield`
      - One solution: **Multiple Inheritance**
      ```C++
      class Enemy: public Draw, public Combat {};
      ```
      ```C++
      class Draw {
          public:
              virtual void draw() = 0;
      };
      ```
      ```C++
      class UI {
          vector<Draw *> v;
      };
      ```
      ```C++
      class Combat {
          public:
              virtual void strike() = 0;
      }
      ```
      ```C++
      class Battlefield {
          vector<Combat *> v;
      }
      ```
      - Example of the **Adapter Pattern**
    - General use of the Adapter Pattern: when a class provides an interface different from the one you need
    - Ex.

        ```
        +------------------+        +----------------+
        | Needed Interface |        | Provided Class |
        +------------------+        +----------------+
        |+ g()             |        |+ f()           |
        +------------------+        +----------------+
                 ^                          ^   
                 |                          |   // This inheritance could be private, 
                 +-------------+------------+   // depends on whether you want the adapter 
                               |                // to still support the old interface
                           +---------+
                           | Adapter |
                           +---------+    +----------+
                           |+ g() ---|----| { f(); } |  // Show's implementation
                           +---------+    +----------+

        ```
      - Private inheritance is when the parent-child relationship between the two classes is only known in the child class, not known to outsiders.
    - _Detour:_ Issues with multiple inheritance

        ```
        +------+        +------+    
        |  A1  |        |  A2  |
        +------+        +------+
        |+ a() |        |+ a() |
        +------+        +------+
            ^               ^

            +-------+-------+

                 +-----+
                 |  B  |    // Has 2 a() methods
                 +-----+
        ```

        ```
                 +-----+
                 |  A  |
                 +-----+
                 |+ a()|
                 +-----+
                    ^
                    |
           +--------+--------+
           |                 |
        +-----+           +-----+           
        |  B  |           |  C  |
        +-----+           +-----+
           |                 |
           +--------+--------+
                    |
                 +-----+        
                 |  D  |    // Has two a() methods, and they're different
                 +-----+        
        ```
        - These are also known as "deadly diamonds"
        ```C++
        class D: public B, public C {
            void f() { ... a() ... }  // Ambiguous, use B::a() or C::a()
        };
        D d;    
        d.a();  // Ambiguous, use d.B::a() or d.C::a()
        ```
    - OR maybe there should be only one `A` base, and therefore only one `a()`
        ```C++
        class B: virtual public A { ... };
        class C: virtual public A { ... };
        ```
    - Virtual inheritance: ensures only one copy of a base class's member variables are inherited by grandchild derived classes
    - Now `d.a()` is no longer ambiguous
    - Ex. iostream hiearchy

      ```
                           ios_base
                              |
                              |
                      .------ios-----.

                   /                    \
                  /                      \
              istream -------------.    ostream----ofstream

           /           \              iostream
          /             \                |    \
         /               \               |     \
        /                 \              |      \
      ifstream       istringstream    fstream  stringstream    
       
      ```
    - _Problem:_ How will a class like `D` be laid out in memory (implementation specific)
        - Consider:
        ```
        +----------+    <-- Should look like an A*, B*, C*, D*, but it doesn't work for C*
        |   vptr   |      
        +----------+
        | A fields |
        +----------+
        | B fields |
        +----------+
        | C fields |
        +----------+
        | D fields |
        +----------+          
        ```
    - What does `g++` do?
        ```C++
        +----------+
        |   vptr   |
        +----------+
        | B fields |
        +----------+
        |   vptr   |
        +----------+
        | C fields |
        +----------+
        |   vptr   |
        +----------+
        | D fields |
        +----------+
        |   vptr   |
        +----------+
        | A fields |
        +----------+
        ```
    - `B` and `C` need to be laid out so that we can find the `A` part but the distance is not known (depends on the runtime of the object)
    - _Solution:_ location of the base object stored in vtable
        - Also note the diagram doesn't simultaneously look like `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`, but slices of it do
        - Therefore pointer assignment among `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` pointers may change the address stored in the pointer
        ```C++
        D *d = ___;
        A *a = d;   // Changes the address
        ```
        - `static_cast`, `const_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, under multiple inheritance will also adjust the value of the pointer (`reinterpret_cast` will not)
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**
    - High level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
    - Abstract classes should never depend on concrete classes
    - Traditional top-down design
        - High level modules _uses_ low level module
        - Ex. `Word count` _uses_ `keyboard reader`
        - What if I want to use a file reader?
          - Changes to details affect the higher level word count module
        - Dependency inversion

            - When the timer hits some specified time, it rings the `Bell` (calls `Bell:notify`, which rings the bell)

            - If Light/Bell's behaviour depends on the time, they may need to depend on the concrete timer for a `getTime` method.
              - Could dependency invert this again if you wanted
              - But at some points you gotta stop, and this is a good point to stop
            - **General Solution:** known as the **Observer Pattern**
            <pre>
            +-----------------+             +-----------------+ 
            | Subject         |⬦----------->| Observer        |
            +-----------------+             +-----------------+ 
            |+ notifyObservers|             |+ notify()       |
            |+ attatch(Obs)   |             +-----------------+ 
            |+ detatch(Obs)   |                      ^
            +----------------+                       |
                    ^                                |
                    |                                |
            +-----------------+             +-------------------+
            | ConcreteSubject |<-----------⬦| Concrete Observer |
            +-----------------+             +-------------------+
            |+ getState()     |             |+ notify()         |
            +-----------------+             +-------------------+
            </pre>
            - Sequence of calls:
                1. `Subject`'s state changes
                2. `Subject::notifyObservers` is called (either by the `Subject` itself OR by some external controller)
                    - Calls each `Observer`'s `notify` 
                3. Each `Observer` calls `concreteSubject::getState` to query the state + react accordingly

## **Some More Design Patterns**

### **Factory Method Pattern**

When you don't know exactly what kind of object you want, and your preferences may vary
- Also called the **Virtual Constructor Pattern**
- Strategy pattern applied to object construction

- Randomly generated
- More turtles in easy levels
- More bullets in hard levels

```C++
class Level {
    public:
        virtual Enemy *getEnemy() = 0;
};
```

```C++
class Easy: public Level {
    public:
        Enemy *getEnemy() override {
            // mostly turtles
        }
};
```

```C++
class Hard: public Level {
    public:
        Enemy *getEnemy() override {
            // mostly bullets
        }
};
```

```C++
Level *l = new Easy;
Enemy *e = l->getEnemy();
```
- We don't know what kind of enemy we got, it's determined by `Easy` or `Hard`.

### **Decorator Pattern**
Add/remove functionality to/from objects at runtime

Ex. add menus/scrollbars to windows - either or both without a combinatorial explosion of subclasses

<pre>
                      +-----------+
                      | Component |<------------+
                      +-----------+             |
                            ^                   |
                            |                   |
          +----------------------------+        |
          |                            |        |
          | // Plain window            |        |
    +--------------------+       +-----------+  |
    | Concrete Component |       | Decorator |◇-+
    +--------------------+       +-----------+
    |+ operation         |             ^
    +--------------------+             |
                                       +------------------------------------+
                                       |                                    |
                            +----------------------+            +----------------------+
// (Window w/ scrollbar)    | Concrete Decorator A |            | Concrete Decorator B | // Window w/ menu
                            +----------------------+            +----------------------+
                            | operation            |            | operation            |
                            +----------------------+            +----------------------+
</pre>

Every `Decorator` IS-A component AND HAS-A `Component`
- `Window w/ scrollbar` is a kind of window, _and_ has a pointer to the underlying plain window
- `Window w/ scrollbar + menu` is a window and has a pointer to a `window w/ scrollbar`, which has a pointer to a `plain window`  

Ex.

```C++
WindowInterface *w = new WindowWithMenu{
                        new WindowWithScrollBar{
                            new Window{}
                        }
                    };
```

### **Visitor Pattern**

For implementing _Double Dispatch_
- Method chosen based on the runtime types of 2 objects, not just one
- Example:

```
              -------
              |Enemy|
              -------
                 ^
                 |
            ------------
            |          |
        --------     --------
        |Turtle|     |Bullet|
        --------     --------

              --------
              |Weapon|
              --------
                 ^
                 |
            ------------
            |          |
       ---------     --------
       | Stick |     | Rock |
       ---------     --------

```
- <u>Effect</u> of striking an enemy with a weapon depends on both the enemy and the weapon
- C++ virtual methods are dispatched on the type of the receiver object, not on the type of params
  - The receiver object is the object that the method is being called on (`vector a; a.push()` then `a` is the receiver object)
  - No way to specify 2 receiver objects
- Visitor pattern: combine overriding with overloading to do a two-stage dispatch


```C++
class Enemy {
public:
    virtual void beStruckBy(Weapon &w) = 0;
};

// we want to have the custom body, even though the two code are the same
// is because we would pass Turtle and Bullet
// and strike can take whatever corresponds to the object
class Turtle: public Enemy {
public:
    void beStruckBy(Weapon &w) override {w.strike(*this);}
};

class Bullet: public Enemy {
public:
    void beStruckBy(Weapon &w) override {w.strike(*this);}
};

class Weapon {
public:
    // Overloading
    virtual void strike(Turtle &t) = 0;
    virtual void strike(Bullet &b) = 0;
};

// Rock would be similar
class Stick: public Weapon {
public:
    void strike(Turtle &t) override {
        //strike turtle with stick
    }

    void strike(Bullet &b) override {
        //strike bullet with stick
    }
}
```

```C++
Enemy *e = new Bullet{...};
Weapon *w = new Rock{...};
e->beStruckBy(*w); 
```

What happens?
- `Bullet::beStruckBy` runs (virtual method dispatch)
- Which calls `Weapon::strike(Bullet &b)` since `*this` is a Bullet
- This fact is known at compile time, overload resolution
- Virtual method resolves to `Rock::Strike(Bullet &)`
- Tight coupling yes, but nothing we can do about it, it gets the job done, and also it only creates tight coupling locally (some methods only)
  
Visitor can also be used to add functionality to a class hierarchy without adding new virtual methods
- Normally if we want to have a functionality that is based on the kind of, say, `Book`, we would need to write a virtual method for `Book` and override it for each subclasses, which is fine
- But sometimes that's not possible. For example you have a weird one-off thing you only want to do it once, and it would be completely unsuitable to mess with the interface, just to add the method
- Or maybe you can't add to the interface, it belongs to someone else and you don't have permissions (well, this means more like you only have one change, or the change you make must follow visitor pattern).
- Use `dynamic_cast`? Violates open/closed. So we will use visitor pattern.
- If we really can't add to the interface (strictly speaking)? Dynamic is the only option.

Add a visitor to the book hierarchy:
```C++
class Book {
    // ...
public:
    // ...
    virtual void accept(BookVisitor &v) { v.visit(*this); }
};

class Text: public Book {
    // ...
public:
    void accept(BookVisitor &v) override { v.visit(*this); }
};

class BookVisitor {
public:
    virtual void visit(Book &b) = 0;
    virtual void visit(Text &t) = 0;
    virtual void visit(Comic &c) = 0;
};
```
- If we compare to the previous example, we know `Book` corresponds to `Enemy`, `accept` corresponds to `beStruckBy` and `visit` corresponds to `strike`.

Example: Categorize and Count.
- For `Book`s: - by Author
- `Text`s: - by Topic
- `Comic`s: - by Hero

Could do this with a virtual method, or write a visitor.
```c++
class Catalog: public BookVisitor {
    public:
    map<string, int> theCat;
    void visit(Book &b) override { ++theCat[b.getAuthor()]; }
    void visit(Text &t) override { ++theCat[b.getTopic()]; }
    void visit(Comic &c) override  { ++theCat[c.getHero()]; }
};
```

### But it won't compile!
- Circular include dependency
- _book.h_, _BookVisitor.h_ include each other
- include guard prevents multiple inclusion
- whichever ends up occurring first will refer to things not yet defined
- Know when an `#include` is actually needed
  - needless includes create artificial compilation dependencies, and slow down compilation, or prevent compilation altogether.

Sometimes a forward class declaration is not good enough.

Consider:
```c++
class A {...}; // A.h

class B {
    A a;
};

class C {
    A *a;
};

class D: public A {
    ...
};

class E {
    A f(A);
};

class F {
    A f(A a) { a.someMethod(); }
};

class G {
    t<A> x;
};
```
Which need includes? `B`,`D`,`F` need includes
- `B` needs include, because in order for the compiler to create `class B`, one of the thing it needs to know is how big a `B` object is, and this only works if we know how big an `A` object is.
- `C` does not need because it's just a pointer, size are always the same. Forward declaration is enough.
- `D` similar to `B` so it needs include.
- `E` is tricky, this is just a method which turns into a function, so we only need to know `A` exists to do type checking. If we want to call that method then yes we need to include `A`, but that's the client's job. Hence, we don't need include.
- `F` is, in a way, similar to `E`, but in the body it is making use of the knowledge about `A`, so we need an include here.
- `G` - it depends on how the template `t` uses A.
  - should collapse to one of the other cases.

Note: class `F` only needs an include because method `f`'s implementation is present.
- a good reason to keep implementation in `.cc`
- where possible: forward declare in `.h`, include in `.cc`

Also notice: `B` needs an include; `C` does not.
- If we want to break the compilation dependency of `B` on `A`, we could make `B` like `C`.

More generally:
```C++
class A1{}; class A2{}; class A3{};

class B {
    A1 a1;
    A2 a2;
    A3 a3;
};
```

_b.h:_
```C++
class BImpl;

class B {
    unique_ptr<BImpl> pImpl;
};
```

_bimpl.h:_
```C++
#include "a1.h"
// ...
class BImpl {
public:
    A1 a1;
    A2 a2;
    A3 a3;
};
```

_b.cc:_
```C++
#include "b.h"
#include "bimpl.h"

methods reference pImpl -> a1, a2, a3
```
_b.h_ no longer compilation-dependent on _a1.h_, etc.
- called the **pImpl idiom** (pointer implementation idiom).

Another advantage of pImpl - pointers have a non-throwing swap.

Can provide the <u>strong guarantee</u> on a `B`'s method by
- Copying the Impl into a new BImpl structure (heap-allocated)
- Having that `B`'s method modifies the copy
- If anything throws, discard the new structure (easy and automatic with `unique_ptr`s)
- If all succeeds swap impl structs (pointer swap - `nothrow`)
- Previous impl automatically destroyed by the smart pointer.

This works if the structure is simple enough so that it's not costly to heap-allocating a duplicate of the structure. And it works well because mutating fields can throw, which is hard to offer strong-guarantee.

Example:
```C++
class B {
    unique_ptr<BImpl> pImpl;
    // ...
    void f() {
        auto temp = make_unique<BImpl>(*pImpl);
        temp->doSomething();
        temp->doSomethingElse();
        std::swap(pImpl,temp); // nothrow
    } // strong guarantee
};
```
